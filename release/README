This is amalgamated single file source release for Octaspire Dern programming
language version 0.344.0. File 'octaspire-dern-amalgamated.c'
is all that is needed; it has no other dependencies than a C compiler and
standard library supporting C99.

Building instructions for all supported platforms (and scripts for building
automatically) can be found in directory 'how-to-build'. Look for a file that
has your platform's name in the file's name. If instructions for your
platform are not yet added, looking instructions for a similar system will
probably help. The amalgamation contains only one source file and should be
straightforward to use. By using few compiler defines, the single file can
be used for different purposes:

    (1) to build stand-alone unit test runner for the file.
    (2) to build stand-alone interactive Dern REPL.
    (3) to use the file as a single file header+library in C/C++ programs
        wanting to embed the Dern language.

Octaspire Dern is work in progress. The most recent version
of this amalgamated source release can be downloaded from:

Directory 'tool-support' contains files that help working with the Dern
language using different tools; there are, for example, syntax files
to allow Dern code to be syntax highlighted in Vim, Emacs, Pygments and
GNU source-highlight.

Directory 'documentation' contains the 'Octaspire Dern Manual'
and directory 'examples' has some short examples.
