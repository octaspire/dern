= Programming in Octaspire Dern

== About

Octaspire Dern is a programming language. It is a dialect of Lisp, having taken influences from
languages scheme and emacs lisp. The name of the language means
an *obscure language*. footnote:[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dern]

Dern should support imperative and functional programming. It has atomic types
*integer*, *real*, (utf-8) *string*, (utf-8) *character*, *boolean*, *nil* and *hash-map*.
As non-atomic type it has *vector*. So, where in scheme `'(1 2 3)` is a list, in Dern it
is a vector.

Every variable and function definition in Dern must be documented by a *documentation string*.
Dern also makes sure that every formal function parameter is documented in the
documentation of function definition. The documentation can be accessed with *doc*-function.

Dern can also be extended with functions written in C; C-functions can be registered
as *builtins* or *specials*. Arguments to builtins are evaluated normally, but to specials
are not, so specials can be used to implement special forms like *if*, etc.

Dern is written in standard *C99* and depends only on C99 compiler, standard library
and *octaspire-core* (container, utf-8, and utility library).

[NOTE]
This is the first language I have ever designed or implemented. There
are also a lot of features not yet implemented and probably bugs not yet fixed. The interpreter
is currently also just a tree walker, and not a faster bytecode vm.
Also, English in not my native language, so please bear with me, especially
when this first piece/draft of documentation is written in a hurry.

== Building from source

To build Dern from source in Raspberry Pi or Debian system:

:source-highlighter: pygments
:pygments-style: colorful
:pygments-linenums-mode: inline
[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get install cmake git
git clone https://gitlab.com/octaspire/dern.git
cd dern
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
----

On different systems the required commands can vary. In any case, You should install
a *C compiler*, *cmake* and *git*.

This is all there should be to it; *octaspire core* is included as a git submodule
and it should be updated and be build automatically, so when make finishes, everything
should be ready.

To run the unit tests:

:source-highlighter: pygments
:pygments-style: colorful
:pygments-linenums-mode: inline
[source,bash]
----
test/octaspire-dern-test-runner
----

To start the REPL with color diagnostics (requires support for ANSI color escapes):

:source-highlighter: pygments
:pygments-style: colorful
:pygments-linenums-mode: inline
[source,bash]
----
./octaspire-dern-repl -c
----

To see the allowed options run:

:source-highlighter: pygments
:pygments-style: colorful
:pygments-linenums-mode: inline
[source,bash]
----
./octaspire-dern-repl -h
----

[NOTE]
Man pages are not ready yet.

== Quick tour of language features

Here we take a quick look of some of the features of the language.

=== Values

:source-highlighter: pygments
:pygments-style: colorful
:pygments-linenums-mode: inline
[source,dern,linenums]
----
 128              ; These are integers
-100
 3.14             ; These are real
-1.12
[Hello]           ; These are strings (utf-8)
[Hello|newline|]
|a|               ; These are characters (utf-8)
|newline|
|tab|
|bar|
true              ; These are booleans
false
nil               ; Nil
'(1 2 |a| [cat])                                   ; These are vectors
'()
(hash-map 'John [likes cats]                       ; This is hash map
          'Lisa [likes dogs]
          'Mike '([likes numbers] 1 2 3 4)
           1    |a|
           [Hi] 2)
----

The text after character *;* is a *comment*. Comments run until the end of the line. Dern
doesn't have multiline comments.

=== Binding names to values with define

:source-highlighter: pygments
:pygments-style: colorful
:pygments-linenums-mode: inline
[source,dern,linenums]
----
(define pi [value for pi] 3.14)
(define names [names list] '(John Lisa Mark))
(define double [doubles numbers] '(x [this is doubled]) (fn (x) (* 2 x)))
----

Here we bind three values to a name: one real, one vector and one function taking one argument.
Here is an example of using those names:

:source-highlighter: pygments
:pygments-style: colorful
:pygments-linenums-mode: inline
[source,dern,linenums]
----
pi
names
(double 1)
----

And to see the documentation for these values:

:source-highlighter: pygments
:pygments-style: colorful
:pygments-linenums-mode: inline
[source,dern,linenums]
----
(doc pi)
(doc names)
(doc double)
----

The documentation of the function contains also documentation for the parameters. 

Function `doc` can also be used with builtins and specials defined by the standard
library or user in C.

[NOTE]
Please note that at the time of writing most of the functions
in Dern's standard library are not yet documented properly. This is a work in progress.


=== Iteration

Dern has two looping constructs: *while* and *for*. For can be used numerically or with a
container (vector, string, hash-map, etc.) Below is couple of examples:

:source-highlighter: pygments
:pygments-style: colorful
:pygments-linenums-mode: inline
[source,dern,linenums]
----
(define i [my counter] 0)
(while (<= i 10) (println [Counting at {}...] i))
----

Numerical for:

:source-highlighter: pygments
:pygments-style: colorful
:pygments-linenums-mode: inline
[source,dern,linenums]
----
(for i from 0 to 10 (println [Hello {} World!] i))
----

Container for:

:source-highlighter: pygments
:pygments-style: colorful
:pygments-linenums-mode: inline
[source,dern,linenums]
----
(define names [names list] '(John Mark Lisa))
(for i in names (println [Hello {} World!] i))
----


=== Comparing and changing values, predicates

Here are few examples:

:source-highlighter: pygments
:pygments-style: colorful
:pygments-linenums-mode: inline
[source,dern,linenums]
----
(<  1 2)   ; true
(<  2 2)   ; false
(>  2 1)   ; true
(<= 1 1)   ; true
(>= 1 1)   ; true
(== 3 3)   ; true
(== 3 1)   ; false
(!= 3 1)   ; true
(+ 1)      ;  1
(+ 1 1)    ;  2
(- 1)      ; -1
(- 1 2 3)  ; -4

(not true)     ; false

(uid +)        ; unique id of +

(len '(1 2 3))          ; length of vector:   3
(len [abc])             ; length of string:   3
(len (hash-map 1 |a|))  ; length of hash-map: 1

(define number [my number] 1)
(++ number)                      ; number is 2
(-- number)                      ; number is 1
(+= number 2)                    ; number is 3

(+ [Hello] [ ] [World.] [ Bye.]) ; Hello World. Bye.

(define greeting [my greeting] [Hello])
(+= greeting [ World!])                 ; Hello World!
(+= greeting |!|)                       ; Hello World!!

(+= '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6))                  ; (1 2 3 (4 5 6))
----

Operators *++*, *--*, *+=*, *==* and *!=* are similar to those in C. Note also that
*the operands need not to be numbers*.

[WARNING]
All the examples above should work, but support for non-numeric types is not finished
on most of the operators. Using those operators with non-numeric arguments
aborts the program or returns error. Complete support for non numeric operands
for the above operators should be implemented in the standard library eventually.


=== Branching and selection

Here are few examples:

:source-highlighter: pygments
:pygments-style: colorful
:pygments-linenums-mode: inline
[source,dern,linenums]
----
(if true  [Yes])         ; Yes
(if false [Yes])         ; nil
(if false [Yes] [No])    ; No

(if true  (println [Yes]) (println [No]))         ; Prints Yes

(if true  (do (println [Yes]) (println [OK])))    ; Prints Yes|newline|OK
----

[NOTE]
Dern should have at some point *select* function that allows
selection of one of many values.


=== Formatted and regular printing

Here are few examples:

:source-highlighter: pygments
:pygments-style: colorful
:pygments-linenums-mode: inline
[source,dern,linenums]
----
(print   [Hi])   ; Prints Hi without newline
(println [Hi])   ; Prints Hi and newline

(define name1  [some name 1] 'Jim)
(define name2  [some name 2] 'Alice)
(define number [some number] 30)

(println [Hi {} and {}! It is {} degrees outside.] name1 name2 number)  ; Prints Hi Jim and Alice! It is 30 degrees outside.
----

=== Formatted string creation

Here are few examples:

:source-highlighter: pygments
:pygments-style: colorful
:pygments-linenums-mode: inline
[source,dern,linenums]
----
(define name1  [some name 1] 'Jim)
(define name2  [some name 2] 'Alice)
(define number [some number] 30)

(string-format [Hi {} and {}! It is {} degrees outside.] name1 name2 number)  ; Creates a sting [Hi Jim and Alice! It is 30 degrees outside.]
----


=== Functions with variable number of arguments

Here are few examples:

:source-highlighter: pygments
:pygments-style: colorful
:pygments-linenums-mode: inline
[source,dern,linenums]
----
(define f [f] '(x [x] ... [varargs]) (fn (x ...) x))

(f 1 2 3)   ; (1 2 3)


(define f [f] '(x [x] y [rest of the args] ... [varargs]) (fn (x y ...) (println x) (println y)))

(f 1 2 3)   ; Prints 1|newline|(2 3)
----

=== Environments

Here are few examples:

:source-highlighter: pygments
:pygments-style: colorful
:pygments-linenums-mode: inline
[source,dern,linenums]
----
(env-global)
(env-current)
(env-new)
----
