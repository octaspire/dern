* There is probably no need to push the arguments vector in builtins and specials in stdlib.c(?), because
  VM pushes the arguments before calling builtin (check specials), or at least it should. All
  argument pushing/popping could be removed from stdlib.c (?) Only
  newly created values need to be pushed/popped there. How about the envrironment
  argument of builtins/specials? Check that it is pushed in VM before builtin/special is called
  and then any pushing/popping of environment argument could be removed from stdlib.c

* Check any place (if exists) where 'octaspire_container_vector_push_back' or similar 
  might be called wihout & and without temp-variable straight with function result.
