This is The Essential Retro Video Game Sound Effects Collection [512 sounds]


Hi, I'm Juhani Junkala, the author of this collection. I'm a classically trained composer, producer and a sound designer with over 20 years of experience.

These sound effects have been released under CC0 creative commons license. You can do anything you want with these sounds.

All the sounds are at 44100hz 16bit mono .wav format and at -6db volume level. Change the individual volume of the sounds manually if necessary.

If the filename has a "loop" in it then the sound loops seamlessly.
